Introduction to Python for Logic Students
=========================================

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in many different fields. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a great language for beginners to learn. In this tutorial, we will focus on the basics of Python, with a focus on topics that are of particular interest to logic students.

Basic Syntax
------------

In Python, like in any other programming language, we use variables to store values. A variable is simply a name that we give to a value, so that we can refer to it later in our code. Here is an example:

Copy code

`# Assign the value 5 to the variable "x"
x = 5`

Notice that in Python, we use the `=` sign to assign a value to a variable. We can also use variables in expressions and assign the result to a new variable:

Copy code

`# Assign the value 10 to the variable "y"
y = 10

# Assign the result of adding x and y to the variable "z"
z = x + y

# Print the value of z to the screen
print(z)`

In the example above, we first assign the value 10 to the variable `y`, then we add `x` and `y` and assign the result to the variable `z`. Finally, we use the `print()` function to print the value of `z` to the screen.

Boolean Values
--------------

In Python, a boolean value is a value that can either be `True` or `False`. Boolean values are often used in conditional statements, which allow us to execute different code depending on whether a certain condition is met. Here is an example:

Copy code

`# Assign the value True to the variable "is_logic_student"
is_logic_student = True

# Check if is_logic_student is True
if is_logic_student:
    # If is_logic_student is True, print this message to the screen
    print("You are a logic student!")
else:
    # If is_logic_student is False, print this message to the screen
    print("You are not a logic student.")`

In the example above, we use an `if` statement to check if the variable `is_logic_student` is `True`. If it is, we print one message to the screen; otherwise, we print a different message.

Comparison Operators
--------------------

In Python, we can use comparison operators to compare two values and determine whether they are equal, greater than, less than, and so on. Here is a list of the comparison operators in Python:

-   `==`: equal to
-   `!=`: not equal to
-   `>`: greater than
-   `<`: less than
-   `>=`: greater than or equal to
-   `<=`: less than or equal to

Here is an example of how we can use comparison operators in an `if` statement:
